	 * the start of the cycle if a cycle is present. (You do not know the length of the list in advance.)
	 * 
	 * Solution: We use the Floyd's Cycle Detection Algorithm, more commonly known as Tortoise and Hare Algorithm.
	 * Simply put, we run two pointers, a slower one that hops one node at a time, and a faster one that hops two nodes
	 * at a time. If they meet before any one of them reaches the end of the list, we've found ourselves a cycle.
	 * 
	 * To find the starting node in the loop, restart the slower pointer from head (keep the faster one where it was at
	 * the end of Floyd's algo.) and advance both one node at a time. The node they meet at is the start of the loop.
