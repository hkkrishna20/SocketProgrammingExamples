	 * its correct position. Then delete from the heap (always the min) and insert an element from the input array.

	 * Q10.8: Design an algorithm for computing the running median of a sequence. The time complexity should be O(log n)

	 * Solution: We use a min heap to store the elements smaller than the running median and a max heap to store the
	 * elements greater (the combination of both keep maintains a sorted stream). The trick is to keep the heaps
	 * balanced such that the difference of their heights is never greater than one. If inserting an element is about to
	 * violate the height balance, we transfer the top element of the heap having more elements to the other one before
	 * the insertion. At any point, the median is either the top element of the heap having more elements (the "middle"
