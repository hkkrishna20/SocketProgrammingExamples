/* Q8.1: Design a stack that supports a max operation, which returns the maximum value stored in the stack, 
 * and throws an exception if the stack is empty. Assume elements are comparable. All operations must be O(1) time. 
 * You can use O(n) additional space, beyond what is required for the elements themselves.
 * 
 * Solution: Keep a max stack in addition to the main stack. Push into it the max of the element or the current value 
 * on top of the stack. Pop from when popping from the main stack.
