/**
 * This class provides pagination support to to any class that does Lucene
 * searches. Lucene does not have a built-in pagination support and it is left
 * to the client code. Lucene, however, does have support for fetching the
 * results in installments where each subsequent installment also contains the
 * records from the previous one; that is where this class comes in. It acts as
 * a sliding window over the set of all results fetched up to that point. Only
 * the results that fall within the window are going to be visible.
 * 
 * Calling code uses the {@link #slideLeft() slideLeft} and
 * {@link #slideRight() slideRight} methods to slide the window. The results,
 * however, are not displayed on the console until a call is made to the
 * {@link #displayResults(IndexSearcher, ScoreDoc[]) displayResults} method.
 * 
 * <STRONG>Note that it is the callers responsibility to set the
 * {@link #maxSlidingArea maxSlidingArea} correctly each time it changes, which
 * is usually each time a new search is made</STRONG>
