/**
 * This class groups the output from {@link CustomerMapper CustomerMapper} and from {@link OrderMapper OrderMapper} so
 * that both customer and order records with the same key (customer ID) are sent to the reducer in one invocation.
 * Without custom grouping, the records are sent separately to the Reducer which forces it to save the records in memory
 * until a match for the key is found in a subsequent iteration. That is not a scalable solution and will run out of
 * memory for large data sets.
