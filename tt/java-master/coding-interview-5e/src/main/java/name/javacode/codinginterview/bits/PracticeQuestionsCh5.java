	 * Q5.1: You are given two 32-bit numbers, N and M, and two bit positions, i and j . Write a method to insert M into
	 * N such that M starts at bit j and ends at bit i. You can assume that the bits j through i have enough space to
	 * fit all of M. That is, if M = 10011, you can assume that there are at least 5 bits between j and i. You would
	 * not, for example, have j = 3 and i = 2,because M could not fully fit between bit 3 and bit 2.
	 * 
	 * EXAMPLE Input: N = 10000000000, M = 10011, i = 2, j = 6 Output:N = 10001001100.
	 * 
	 * Solution: Since int is 32-bit in Java, we use int for M and N. The solution is 2 stepped. 
	 * First we clear out the bits j through i from N. Then we do a bitwise OR of M and N.
