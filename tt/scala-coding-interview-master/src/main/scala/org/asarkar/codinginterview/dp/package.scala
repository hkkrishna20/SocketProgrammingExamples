   * Given an array A of distinct positive integers, and an integer k, how many subsets of the array sum to k?
   *
   * ANSWER: Consider the last element of A; it may or may not be included in a subset that sums to k. If it's included,
   * then the number of subsets that sum to k is equal to the number of subsets of A - {A[i]} that sum to k - A[i].
   * If it's not included, then the number of subsets that sum to k is equal to the number of subsets of A - {A[i]}
   * that sum to k. Note that if the last element is greater than the sum k, it can't be included in any subset that
   * sums to k, and the first case doesn't apply.
   * Let dp[i][j] be the number of subsets that sum to j with or without the i-th element. When i = 0, no elements are
   * included, and no subsets are possible. When j = 0, only one set can add up to the empty set

   * Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock, if you're allowed n transactions
   *
   * ANSWER:
   * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDhu5uGq_ic
   *
   * Let dp(i)(j) is the max profit made by making i transactions till the j-th day.
   * On the j-th day, we have two choices:
   * 1. We make no transactions, i.e. neither sell not buy any stocks. In this case, the max profit is the same as
   *    what was on the previous (j - 1) day.
   * 2. We sell the stock we're holding, and buy a new one. In this case, the max profit is the difference of the
   *    selling price on the j-th day and the buying price on the day the stock was bought, plus the profit that was
   *    on the j-th day before buying the stock. Since we don't know which day the stock was bought, we will try all
   *    days until the previous day (j - 1).
   *
   * Thus, dp(i)(j) = max { dp(i)(j - 1), prices(j) - prices(k) + dp(i - 1)(k) }, k = 0 to j - 1
   *
   * This algorithm works, but has a time complexity of  O(|prices| x nÂ²). The squared term comes from the fact that
   * for each day, we are iterating over all values of days until the current one.
   *
   * Can we do better? To answer that, let's look at the second term more closely.
   * prices(j) + (dp(i - 1)(k) - prices(k))
   *
   * prices(j) is constant for a given j. At the end of each iteration of j, if we compare the maximum value for
   * dp(i - 1)(k) - prices(k) with dp(i - 1)(j) - prices(j), and store it for the next iteration,
   * we don't have to start over from j = 0 every time. That brings us to the following improved formula:
   *
   * dp(i)(j) = max { dp(i)(j - 1), prices(j) + max { dp(i - 1)(j) - prices(j), maxDiff } }
   *
   * Initially, since we have no previous profit, and no stock to sell, maxDiff is negative value of the first price,
   * since buying the stock incurs cost that we have not recovered yet. We reset this value whenever we start from day
   * one, i.e. for every i.
   *
   * Now, calculating the second term takes only couple of max operations(O(1)); thus, overall time complexity is
   * O(|prices| x n).

   * Given a list of integers, write a function that returns the largest sum of non-adjacent numbers.
   * Numbers can be 0 or negative.
   * Follow-up: Can you do this in O(N) time and constant space?
   *
   * ANSWER: Let dp(i) denote the maximum sum up to the i-th element. If the i-th element is included in the max sum,
   * dp(i) is obtained by adding it with the max sum obtained so far up to the (i - 2)-th element. If the i-th element

   * sum of the 1st and the last elements, not the sum of the 1st and 3rd or the 2nd and the last elements.
   *
   * We could iterate over all values of j in [0, i - 2] for each i, but that would give us an O(n^2) algorithm. Instead,
   * for each i, we keep track of the max value until i - 2. That gives us a O(n) algorithm. Also note that, in order to

   * How many ways to decode this message? For example, given encoding a = 1, b = 2, c = 3, ..., z = 26, what does the
   * encoded string '12' represent? It could be 'ab' or 'l'. For simplicity, assume that the encoded string contains
   * only digits 0-9. Can you solve this in O(n) time, where n is the length of the encoded string?
   *
   * ANSWER: Observe that the number of ways is simply the number of leaves in the recursion tree. If we represent
   * the number of ways to decode a message of length n to be N(n), observe that N(n) = N(n - 1) + N(n - 2),
   * where the second term is present only if the first two characters converted to a digit is smaller than the maximum
   * digit in the encoding. For the given question, the maximum digit is 26 corresponding to the letter 'z'. Similarly,
   * if the message starts with a digit smaller than the minimum digit in the encoding (1, corresponding to 'a'), there
   * is no way to decode it.
   *
   * To avoid creating new strings, we introduce 'i' as the number of characters to consider from the right. Since the
   * subproblems are overlapping (notice the recurrence above, it looks very much like Fibonacci), we also memoize the
   * intermediate results to avoid recalculations.

   * Given a string which we can delete at most k, return whether you can make a palindrome.
   * For example, given 'waterrfetawx' and a k of 2, you could delete f and x to get 'waterretaw'.
   *
   * ANSWER: This is a special case of the edit distance problem, where we check if a string s can be converted to a
   * string p by only deleting characters from either or both strings.
   *
   * This problem exhibits optimal substructure (if a string is a k-palindrome, some substrings are also k-palindromes),
   * and overlapping subproblems (the solution requires comparing the same substrings more than once).
   *
   * Let the string be s and its reverse rev. Let dp[i][j] be the number of deletions required to convert the first i
   * characters of s to the first j characters of rev. Since deletions have to be done in both strings,
   * if dp[n][n] <= 2 * k, then the string is a k-palindrome.
   *
   * Base case: When one of the strings is empty, all characters from the other string need to be deleted in order
   * to make them equal.
   *
   * Time complexity: O(n^2).
   *
   * Since we are doing bottom-up DP, an optimization is to return false if at any time i == j && dp[i][j] > 2 * k,
   * since all subsequent i == j must be greater.
