  /*
   * Suppose we represent our file system by a string in the following manner:
   *
   * The string "dir\n\tsubdir1\n\tsubdir2\n\t\tfile.ext" represents:
   * dir
   *  subdir1
   *  subdir2
   *    file.ext
   *
   * The directory dir contains an empty sub-directory subdir1 and a sub-directory subdir2 containing a file file.ext.
   *
   * The string "dir\n\tsubdir1\n\t\tfile1.ext\n\t\tsubsubdir1\n\tsubdir2\n\t\tsubsubdir2\n\t\t\tfile2.ext" represents:
   * dir
   *   subdir1
   *     file1.ext
   *     subsubdir1
   *   subdir2
   *     subsubdir2
   *       file2.ext
   *
   * The directory dir contains two sub-directories subdir1 and subdir2. subdir1 contains a file file1.ext and an empty
   * second-level sub-directory subsubdir1. subdir2 contains a second-level sub-directory subsubdir2 containing a file
   * file2.ext.
   *
   * We are interested in finding the longest (number of characters) absolute path to a file within our file system.
   * For example, in the second example above, the longest absolute path is "dir/subdir2/subsubdir2/file2.ext", and its
   * length is 32 (not including the double quotes).
   *
   * Given a string representing the file system in the above format, return the length of the longest absolute path to
   * a file in the abstracted file system. If there is no file in the system, return 0.
   *
   * Note:
   * The name of a file contains at least a period and an extension.
   * The name of a directory or sub-directory will not contain a period.
   *
   * ANSWER: Observe that the file system lists all the subdirectories and files under a directory before listing its
   * siblings or higher up directories. That means if we process one segment of the file system at a time, indicating
   * the level of a segment by the number of preceding tabs, when we encounter a segment whose level is equal to or
   * smaller than the path we are exploring, we can be sure that we have completely explored the current path.
   *
   * This suggests a DFS as follows.
   * For the current segment:
   *  - If its level is greater than that of the current path, we continue exploring this path. Keeping with the DFS
   *    analogy, this is equivalent to recursively visiting a subtree of a node.
   *  - If its level is less than or equal to that of the current path, we climb up until we find a segment that falls
   *    in the above case. This is equivalent to finding a subtree higher up that has not yet been visited.
   *
   * The only other thing we need to do is to remember the longest path seen for a file during the traversal.
   *
   * We use regular expression for extracting the current segment. It works nicely because we can start a new match
   * from after the end of the previous match without having to extract substrings.

   * Given a dictionary of words and a string made up of those words (no spaces), return the original sentence in a

   *
   * ANSWER: We use a recursive backtracking approach with memoization. For each string, if it is not in the
   * dictionary, we remember it, and then try again by progressively splitting from the end. Each of these splits
   * correspond to a subtree in the recursion tree.
   * For example, consider the dictionary ["a", "b", "c", "ab", "bc", "abc"] and string "abcd". The corresponding
   * recursion tree is shown below. The dictionary checks are not show for brevity.
   * - Since "abcd" is not in the dictionary, we split it into "abc" and "d", and go into recursion with "d".
   * - Since "d" is not in the dictionary, we split into "ab" and "cd" and go into recursion with "cd", which, in turn,
   * recurses into "d". Now, having previously unsuccessfully checked "d", we remember it, and prune this branch
   * straightaway.
   * - Since "cd" is not in the dictionary, we split into "a" and "bcd", and go into recursion with "bcd", which,
   * in turn, recurses into "cd" and "d". Having previously unsuccessfully checked both, we prune these branches
   * without the need for further recursion.
   *
   *              abcd
   *   +-----------------------+
   *   bcd         cd         d
   *    +           +
   * +--+--+        +
   * cd    d        d
   *
   * A total of seven calls are made. Since length("abcd") = 4, the number of calls is O(2^(n-1)) - 1, so, the time
   * complexity is exponential.
   *
   * This problem can also be solve by Dynamic Programming, see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WepWFGxiwRs

   * Given an undirected graph represented as an adjacency matrix and an integer k, write a function to determine
   * whether each vertex in the graph can be colored such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color using at
   * most k colors.
   *
   * ANSWER: Vertex coloring is in general a NP-hard problem. For small |V|, we may use backtracking to find a solution.
   * Without any constraints, each vertex can be colored in k ways, and there are n vertices, so the number of possible
   * combinations is O(k^n). Even with the constraint that no two adjacent vertices may share the same color, in the
   * worst case, we may backtrack k times for each vertex, and if the graph is complete, for each of the k iterations,
   * we try n - 1 neighbors. Thus time complexity is still O(k^n).
   *
   * The algorithm is as follows:
   *
   * for v in vertices
   *   if it's safe to assign color c
   *     assign color c to v, and recursively color the rest of the vertices
   *     if successful, return true
   *     else uncolor v and try the next color
   *   else try the next color
   * if all vertices have been colored, return true
   *
   * For k = 2, the problem becomes determining whether the given graph is bipartite or not.  Such a coloring of the
   * vertices of a bipartite graph means that the graph can be drawn with the red vertices on the left and the blue
   * vertices on the right such that all edges go from left to right.
   *
   * Testing whether a graph is bipartite is easy. Color the first vertex blue, and then do a depth-first search of the
   * graph. Whenever we discover a new, uncolored vertex, color it opposite that of its parent, since the same color
   * would cause a clash. If we ever find an edge where both vertices have been colored identically, then the graph
   * cannot be bipartite. Otherwise, this coloring will be a 2-coloring, and it is constructed in O(n + m) time.
   *
   * Application of vertex coloring:
   * Vertex coloring models to a number of scheduling problems. Given a set of jobs need to be assigned to time slots,
   * each job requires one such slot. Jobs can be scheduled in any order, but pairs of jobs may be in conflict in the
   * sense that they may not be assigned to the same time slot, for example because they both rely on a shared resource.
   * The corresponding graph contains a vertex for every job and an edge for every conflicting pair of jobs.
   * The chromatic number of the graph is exactly the minimum makespan, the optimal time to finish all jobs without
   * conflicts.
   *
   * Other examples can be found in this YouTube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4RAYQjKb5Y

   * ANSWER: We want to return a NxN matrix where the value of each cell is the i-th move; in other words, a value

  /*
   * You are playing the following Nim Game with your friend: There is a heap of stones on the table, each time one of
   * you take turns to remove 1 to 3 stones. The one who removes the last stone will be the winner. You will take the
   * first turn to remove the stones.
   *
   * Both of you are very clever and have optimal strategies for the game. Write a function to determine whether you
   * can win the game given the number of stones in the heap.
   *
   * Example:
   * Input: 4
   * Output: false
   * Explanation: If there are 4 stones in the heap, then you will never win the game; no matter 1, 2, or 3 stones you
   * remove, the last stone will always be removed by your friend.
   *
   * ANSWER: As in any adversarial game, player 1 wins if he can play a move after which player 2 cannot win.
   *
   * Case 1: For n = 1, 2 or 3, player 1 wins by removing all the stones.
   * Case 2: For n = 4, no matter how many stones player 1 removes, player 2 falls in case 1, and wins. Thus, player 1
   * can't win.
   * Case 3: For n = 5, 6, or 7, player 1 can remove 1, 2, or 3 stone to put player 2 in case 2. Player 1 wins.
   * Case 4: For n = 8, no matter how many stones player 1 removes, player 2 falls in case 3, and wins. Thus, player 1
   * can't win.
   *
   * Proceeding this way, we see that for n any multiple of 4, player 1 can't win.
