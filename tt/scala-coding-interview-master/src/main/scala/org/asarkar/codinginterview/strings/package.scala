   * Given an integer k and a string s, find the length of the longest substring that contains at most k distinct
   * characters.
   * For example, given s = "abcba" and k = 2, the longest substring with k distinct characters is "bcb".
   *
   * ANSWER: A brute force solution would be to find all substrings of the given string, and then count the frequency
   * of distinct characters in each one. To derive the number of substrings of a string, we observe that:
   * Number of substrings of length one is n (We can choose any of the n characters).
   * Number of substrings of length two is n-1 (We can choose any of the n-1 pairs formed by adjacent characters).
   * Number of substrings of length three is n-2 (We can choose any of the n-2 triplets formed by adjacent characters).
   *
   * In general, number of substrings of length k is n-k+1 where 1 <= k <= n.
   * Total number of substrings of all lengths from 1 to n is given by:
   * n + (n-1) + (n-2) + (n-3) + ... + 2 + 1
   * = n * (n + 1)/2
   * = O(n^2)
   *
   * If we keep track of the number of distinct characters in each substring while building it, we get a O(n^2)
   * solution. Can we do better?
   *
   * We can! The idea is maintain a sliding window that expands on the right until the number of distinct characters in
   * the window exceeds k. At that point, we shrink the window from the left until the the number of distinct characters
   * in the window is less than or equal to k, and then continue expanding on the right.
   * The algorithm terminates when the left boundary touches the right (only possible for k > 1), or the right boundary

   * Given a string, find the longest palindromic contiguous substring. If there are more than one with the maximum

   *
   * ANSWER: The trivial algorithm for this is to consider each character as the center of a potential palindrome, and

   * but may take O(n^2) time in the worst case. To see why, consider the string "aaaaa". We do zero comparison for the

   * the middle element, which adds up to (n/2 * (n/2 + 1)) / 2).
   * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1_%2B_2_%2B_3_%2B_4_%2B_%E2%8B%AF
   *
   * Can we do better?
   *
   * We can, using Manacher's algorithm. The idea is to cut down the number of comparisons by utilizing the information
   * learned so far, and by making some cleaver insights. Let's introduce some notations first:
   * T: Given string transformed to insert a special character '#' in between every two characters, and also at the
   *    beginning and the end. This transforms every word to an odd-length word, thus allowing us to reason about the
   *    algorithm without having to worry about whether the given word is of odd-length or even. '#' is a random char
   *    chosen such that it already doesn't exist in the given string.
   * C: Center of the largest palindrome found so far.
   * R: Right edge of the palindrome centered at C; R >= C.
   * i: Some index > C.
   * P: Array that stores the length of the longest palindrome for 0 <= j < i.
   *
   * Since a palindrome is mirrored around its center, T[C - k] = T[C + k] for 0 <= k <= R - C. Let i' be the mirror of
   * i with respect to C, i.e. C - i' = i - C. What can we deduce about P[i] knowing P[i']?
   *
   * Case 1, P[i'] < R - C: The palindrome centered at i' is completely contained in the palindrome centered at C. In
   * this case, we can say that P[i] = P[i']. Why? Since there is a palindrome centered at C, T[i + k] = T[i' - k] for
   * all 0 <= k <= R - C. If P[i] could be larger than P[i'], we would have a contradiction. It would mean that we would
   * be able to extend the palindrome centered at i beyond P[i'], but if we could, then we would also be able to extend
   * the palindrome centered at i' due to the symmetry, but it was already supposed to be as large as possible.
   *
   * Case 2, P[i'] > R - C: P[i] = R - i. Why? Suppose P[i] were longer than this: that would imply that
   * T[R + 1] = T[i - (R - i + 1)]. T[i - (R - i + 1)] = T[i' + (R - i + 1)] because there's a palindrome centred at C;
   * and T[i' + (R - i + 1)] = T[i' - (R - i + 1)] because there's a palindrome of width at least R - i + 1 centred at
   * i' (since we have assumed P[i'] > R - i). i' - (R - i + 1) = L - 1, so what this means is that
   * T[R + 1] = T[L - 1]. But this is a contradiction since in that case, P[C] wouldn't be the largest.
   *
   * Case 3, P[i'] = R - C: We know P[i] to be at least at large at P[i'], but it can be larger, since we don't know
   * anything about the characters beyond R. Thus, we expand by launching the trivial algorithm beyond R.
   *
   * Case 2 and 3 can be coded as min(R - C, P[i']), and then by expanding. This doesn't increase the time complexity,
   * because in case 2, the expansion would fail immediately.
   *
   * Time Complexity is O(n), although I've not found a rigorous proof for this, and people seem to be hand waving the
   * analysis. The trivial algorithm takes linear time in the worst case, but how may times we launch the linear
   * algorithm is unclear.

   * Since the empty string is considered a palindrome, we can combine the above conditions into the second one.
   *
   * Thus, we need an algorithm for condition #2. If we build a Trie using the reverse strings, we can efficiently
   * check for prefix matches. Once we have a match, to check whether the rest of the string is a palindrome or not,
   * we store that information while building the Trie. Each node stores a list indices corresponding to the words
   * in the input list if the rest of the string is a palindrome.
   *
   * The Trie for "abc" and "ddcba" would be as follows:
   *
   *     +--+a
   *     +   +
   *     c   b
   *     +   +
   *     +   c [1]
   *     b   +
   *     +   d
   * [0] a   +
   *         d [1]
   *
   * The algorithm is then simply finding the node where a word ends, and adding the pairs (index, other index) to
   * the answer. Note that the order of elements in the pair is important.
   *
   * Time complexity: Let n be the number of words, and m the length of the longest word. Since we scan the rest of the
   * string for each index position, we spend O(m^2) time inserting the word in the Trie. Finding it is O(m); thus,
   * overall time complexity is O(nm + nm^2).

   * Lexicographically least circular substring is the problem of finding the rotation of a string possessing the
   * lowest lexicographical order of all such rotations. For example, the lexicographically minimal rotation of
   * "bbaaccaadd" would be "aaccaaddbb".
   *
   * A O(n) time algorithm was proposed by Jean Pierre Duval (1983).
   *
   * Given two indices i and j, Duval's algorithm compares string segments of length j - i starting at i and j (called
   * a "duel"). If (index + j - i) is greater than the length of the string, the segment is formed by wrapping around.
   *
   * For example, consider s = "baabbaba", i = 5 and j = 7. Since j - i = 2, the first segment starting at i = 5 is
   * "ab". The second segment starting at j = 7 is constructed by wrapping around, and is also "ab".
   * If the strings are lexicographically equal, like in the above example, we choose the one starting at i as the
   * winner, which is i = 5.
   *
   * The above process repeated until we have a single winner. If the input string is of odd length, the last character
   * wins without a comparison in the first iteration.
   *
   * Time complexity:
   * The first iteration compares n strings each of length 1 (n/2 comparisons), the second iteration may compare n/2
   * strings of length 2 (n/2 comparisons), and so on, until the i-th iteration compares 2 strings of length n/2
   * (n/2 comparisons). Since the number of winners is halved each time, the height of the recursion tree is log(n),
   * thus giving us a O(n log(n)) algorithm. For small n, this is approximately O(n).
   *
   * Space complexity is O(n) too, since in the first iteration, we have to store n/2 winners, second iteration n/4
   * winners, and so on. (Wikipedia claims this algorithm uses constant space, I don't understand how).
   *

   * opposite bit in the Trie. This is because we want as many '1's in the max XOR as possible, and by definition,
   * the XOR of two bits is 1 only when they are different. If we find the opposite bit, then the XOR of 's'
   * with the number(s) being traversed has a '1' at this position, so we calculate the decimal equivalent, and add to
   * the running XOR. If we don't find the opposite bit, then the XOR of 's' has a '0' as this position, and we don't
   * change the running XOR.

   * Given a string and a pattern, find the starting indices of all occurrences of the pattern in the string.
   *
   * For example, given the string "abracadabra" and the pattern "abr", you should return [0, 7].
   *
   * ANSWER: Let n be the length of the string s, and m the length of the pattern p. We can take every substring of s
   * of length m, and compare with p. If they match, we add the starting index of the substring to the result.
   * This works, but there are n - m + 1 such substring, and comparing each pair would take m comparisons, thus giving
   * us a O(mn - m^2 + m) time. Can we do better?
   *
   * We can! The key observation is that each substring is generated by a sliding window of size m that moves one step
   * to the right each time. m - 1 characters in that window don't change; the left one drops off, and a new one
   * comes in at the right. Thus, we are wasting time comparing the complete substring over and over again.
   *
   * Instead, we calculate the hash of the first window using a hash function. For each subsequent window, we update
   * the hash using the rolling hash function. Calculating the first hash takes O(m) time, and all subsequent ones
   * takes constant time to calculate.
   * The loop runs n - m times, giving us an overall time complexity of O(m) + O(n - m). For n >> m, this is
   * practically O(n).
   *
   * Due to hash collisions, we should still compare the substrings if the hashes match. With a bad hashing function,
   * that still gives us the same worst came running time as the naive algorithm, but in reality, we can choose a good
   * hash function to reduce the chances of collision.
   *
   * This is known as the Rabin-Karp algorithm.

   * Given a string S and a string T, find the minimum window in S which will contain all the characters in T in

   * If there is no such window in S that covers all characters in T, return the empty string "".
   * If there is such window, you are guaranteed that there will always be only one unique minimum window in S.
   *
   * ANSWER: We start a sliding window, and keep track of whether the window contains all chars from "t".
   * Note than "t" may have duplicates, and all chars, including dupes, must be present in the min window. For example,
   * if s = "aabc", and t = s, the min window string is "aabc", not "abc".
   *
   * To determine if the current window is a potential solution, we keep a char freq map of "t" as reference. We
   * maintain another freq map for the current window for the chars present in "t". At each iteration, we try to
   * extend the window to the right by one char only if the incoming char is present in "t". If successful,
   * we try to shrink the window from the left as long as it doesn't invalidate the current solution.
   *
   * For example, let s = "aabc", t = "abc". We start with the window = "a", which is not a solution. Since the next
   * char 'a' is present in "t", we take it in, and the next char 'b', and the next char 'c'; the window is now "aabc".
   * This is a solution, but not the min one. We then try to shrink the window without invalidating the solution,
   * and we can drop 'a' from the left.
   *
   * To avoid comparing the frequency maps, we keep a variable count that is incremented once for each char from
   * "t" when we have seen the char as many times as present in "t". For example, t = "aabc", count would be
   * incremented when we have seen two counts of 'a', one count of 'b', and one count of 'c'. When count is equal to
   * the size of the reference frequency map, we have a candidate solution. We then check if the current window is
   * smaller than the current min window, and if yes, update the boundaries.
   *
   * Time complexity: O(n). The for loop runs n times. Although it may look like the nested while loop adds to the time
   * complexity, it only runs n times, because start is incremented inside it, and start can only be less than n.
